This is intended to be a very short post, an often-revisited reminder of the syntax for joins in `data.table`.

When doing joins in data.table I often have to open a new R session and run the next code:

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(data.table)

```

```{r}
a <- data.table(x = 1:3, y = 2:4)
b <- data.table(x = 2:5, z = 3:6)
a[b, on = .(x)]
```

in order to realize that the look-up table was `a` and not `b`. It seems I tend to read it as _"take `a` and look up its `x` column in `b`"_, which is obviously wrong.

It should be read as _"show me the table `a` **having** `b`"_.

So from now on my mnemonic will be _"What's going on in the inside shows on the outside"_[^1].
